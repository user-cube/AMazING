# AMazING
The AMazING (Advanced Mobile wIreless Network playGround) is a testbed that envisions the scheduling and reproducibility of networking experiments. It is composed by 24 fixed nodes with wireless capabilities and a mobile node (ie., the robot)

Such experiments can range from the testing of new protocols to wireless interference tests.

Additionally, the rail allows the robot to move around the nodes, mimicking the user's movement in its approach and move away to/from the access points.
